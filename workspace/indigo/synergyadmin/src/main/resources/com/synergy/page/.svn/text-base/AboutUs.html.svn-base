        <p>Synergy Chat was started with the goal of creating rich cloud computing applications for video communication across the web. The key goal of Synergy Chat was to make all of our applications run with only the use of a web browser, taking advantage of the cloud computing concept. By having all of our applications to run with only a web browser we allow for quick and easy communication between two parties, removing the need for downloaded software. 
        With Synergy Chat anyone anywhere around the world can video communicate in a safe and secure environment. </p> 
        <br/>
        <p>After a year of intense programming Synergy Chat has successfully created video chat, video conference and video email cloud applications. We are always working on adding to our feature rich cloud applications as well as fine tuning our current technology. We have strategically placed our cloud hosting servers inside of a one of a kind datacenter, 
        the NAP of the Americas. The NAP allows Synergy Chat virtually unlimited bandwidth and quick access to the entire globe. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>All of our browser based applications are easily accessed with the use of a simple JavaScript button which can be easily placed on any website, blog, social networking page and more. This JavaScript button quickly allows any visitor and any Synergy Chat member to quickly communicate with full audio and video. Not only can you video chat face to face with guests and other members, but you can also host a video conference 
        with up to nine people and even send video email. Everything is hosting by Synergy Chat so zero hard drive space is required by the user.</p>
        <br/> 
        <p>New feature rich applications are also being developed including Shared Screen, 
        HD video quality, VOIP, advanced conference features, mobile cloud video communication and 
        even more. We are constantly trying to improve our applications.</p>
    	<br/>
    	<p>Please feel free to register for our beta and try out our cloud applications. We encourage everyone to try out Synergy Chat even if you do not currently have a website, blog 
    	or other online web page. You can still send video email, host a video conference 
    	and video chat even if you do not have a personal online page.</p>
